# Movie Filtering – Unit Tests

![Preview](src/assets/img/test.png "Test Preview")

## Sprint Description

This project focuses on passing a series of **unit tests** related to movie filtering.  
You don't need to render anything on screen — your goal is to implement functions that **return the correct results** when tested.

> 💡 You’ll work with an array of movie objects and create functions to search, filter, and analyze information from it.
